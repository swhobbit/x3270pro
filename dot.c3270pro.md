# dot.c3270pro (`.c3270pro`) keymap for `c3270` README

## Overview

[`dot.c3270pro`](dot.c3270pro) configures key mapping for `c3270` as used by the author (swhobbit@derbyshire.us) to access VM. To use, it should be saved in your home directory as `.c3270pro`.

**Note:** When available, `x3270` gives a better user experience than `c3270`.  `c3270` is useful when `x3270` is not appropriate, for example using for a long running system console under the program `screen`.

## `c3270.sh` Wrapper

Once opened in a terminal window, the `c3270` emulator size is both arbitrary and fixed; if wrong (too large), it cannot be changed without restarting the program. The fixed size is less of issue with `x3270` because it _does__ check the screen and generate a new window that fits. However, `c3270` does not check the terminal window size and simply generates a default terminal size (by default, 43 lines).

The wrapper script [`c3270.sh`](c3270.sh) checks the terminal size and invokes `c3270` with the largest 3270 model size appropriate for the window.

**Note**: When the terminal window is at least 132 columns, `c3270.sh` will favor emulating a [3270 model 5](Readme#Terminal-Sizes) over a taller but narrower terminal.

***Note***: When using `c3270`, make the terminal window two lines _higher_ than the desired the 3270 terminal size _before_ running the program. This allows room for the top & bottom lines of chrome.

## Profile overview

The `dot.c3270pro` profile adds, tweaks, and in some cases out-and-out corrects various items in the default setup.  Below is the primary layout by the author with alternatives.

**Note**: Various keys combinations are reserved by the operating system.  For example on MacOS Meta-I is intercepted by the `Terminal` to put up an Info box.

**Note:** No shifted keys combinations are available under `c3270`.

### Important Client keys

| Function	| Emulator Key	| Emulator Alternatives	| Notes	|
| -----------	| ------------	| ---------------------	| -----	|
| `Logical Not (Â¬)`	| Caret (Shift-6, AKA "`^`")	|
| `Insert`	| Insert	| Alt-Help, Ctrl-Help	| MacOS has a `Help` key instead of `Insert`; the unmodified key cannot be read by x3270, hence the modifier keys. The `Insert` function actually toggles insert mode on/off, which is the typical action on a modern desktop system. A true 3270 keyboard uses `Insert` to turn on insert and `Reset` to turn it off. alternatives are provided.	|
| `Client Paste`| Alt-V	| Shift-Insert, Mouse Button 2 (middle)	|
| `Delete Word`	| Shift-Delete	| `Delete Word` deletes to the *left*.  Attempts to housebreak it and have it delete to the right have failed	|
| `Delete Field`	| Control-U	|
| `Word Right`	| Alt-Right Arrow	| Alt-Right Arrow	|
| `Word Left`	| Alt-Left Arrow	| Alt-Left Arrow	|
| `Erase EOF`	|	|	| Pop up key pad only. When in an unprotected field, `Erase EOF` erases from the cursor to the end of the field)	|
| `Delete`	| Delete	|	| `Delete` deletes the character under the cursor.  It is *not* a backspace which deletes to left.|
| `Reset`	| Alt-R	| Ctrl-R	|
| `Newline`	| 	| | Pop-up Keypad
