# dot.x3270pro (`.x3270pro`) keymap for `x3270` README

## Overview

[`dot.x3270pro`](dot.x3270pro) configures key mapping for `x3270` as used by the author (swhobbit@derbyshire.us) to access VM. To use, it should be saved in your home directory as `.x3270pro`.

### Terminal Sizes

The standard terminal sizes for 3270 emulation are:

  | Model | Lines | Columns |
  | ----- | ----- | ------  |
  |  2    |   24  |   80    |
  |  3    |   32  |   80    |
  |  4    |   43  |   80    |
  |  5    |   27  |   132   |

## Installing x3270

See [README](README#get-3270)

## Profile overview

The profile adds, tweaks, and in some cases out-and-out corrects various items in the default setup for x3270 keys. Below is the primary layout by the author with alternatives.

### Program Attention Keys (PAK)

These keys all generate an interrupt to the host.

| 3270 Key    | Emulator Key | Emulator Alternatives | Notes |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ----- |
| `Enter`     | Return       |
| `Clear`     | Alt-C        | Meta-C     |

| `PA2`       | F14 (aka `Scroll Lock`)| Meta-2, Keypad-Multiply (aka keypad "*") |*Keypad-Multiply is x3270 only*|
| `PA3`       | F13 (aka `Pause`)| Meta-3      |
|
| `PF1`         | F1  |
| `PF2`         | F2  |
| `PF3`         | F3  |
| `PF4`         | F4  |
| `PF5`         | F5  |
| `PF6`         | F6  |
| `PF7`         | F7  | Page Up |
| `PF8`         | F8  | Page Down |

| `PF14`        | Shift-F2  | Keypad-8 |
| `PF15`        | Shift-F3  | Keypad-9 |
| `PF16`        | Shift-F4  | Keypad-4 |
| `PF17`        | Shift-F5  | Keypad-5 |
| `PF18`        | Shift-F6  | Keypad-6 |
| `PF19`        | Shift-F7  | Keypad-1 |
| `PF20`        | Shift-F8  | Keypad-2 |
| `PF21`        | Shift-F9  | Keypad-3 |
| `PF22`        | Shift-F10 | Keypad-0 |
| `PF23`        | Shift-F11 | Keypad-Decimal (AKA keypad "`.`") |
| `PF24`        | Shift-F12 | Keypad-Enter, Keypad-Plus (AKA keypad "`+`") |
---

**Note**: Various keys are reserved by the operating system.  For example on MacOS plain `Help` (Insert) is intercepted.

### Important Client keys

| Function    | Emulator Key | Emulator Alternatives |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| `Logical Not (Â¬)` | Caret (Shift-6, AKA "`^`") |
| `Insert`    | Insert       | Alt-Help, Meta-Help, Ctrl-Help | MacOS has a `Help` key instead of `Insert`; the unmodified key cannot be read by x3270, hence the modifier key alternatives are provided. |
| `Client Paste`| Meta-V       | Shift-Insert, Mouse Button 2 (middle) |
| `Delete Word` | Shift-Delete | `Delete Word` deletes to the *left*.  Attempts to housebreak it and have it delete to the right have failed |
| `Delete Field` | Control-U   |
| `Word Right`  | Meta-Right Arrow | Alt-Right Arrow |
| `Word Left`  | Meta-Left Arrow | Alt-Left Arrow |
| `Erase EOF` | Shift-End    | When in an unprotected field, `Erase EOF` erases from the cursor to the end of the field) |
| `Delete`    | Delete  |  | `Delete` deletes the character under the cursor.  It is *not* a backspace which deletes to left.|
| `Reset`     | Meta-R       | Ctrl-R |
| `Newline`   | Shift-Return |
----

**Note**: The `Insert` function actually toggles insert mode on/off, which is the typical action on a modern desktop system. A true 3270 keyboard uses `Insert` to turn on insert and `Reset` to turn it off.


## Using console on Windows (wc3270) and UNIX/Mac OS

### Profile Overview

In a manner similar to the X windows profile, the c3270 profile tweaks, and in some cases out-and-out corrects various items in the default setup for c3270 keys. For example, it adds an insert toggle.  It is not extensive or as tested as the X Windows profile -- the author follows his own advice and uses the X windows version whenever possible.

### c3270.sh

Once opened in a console window, the emulator cannot be resized. This is less of issue with `x3270` because it will always generate a window appropriate for the model of 3270 requested.  However, `c3270` itself does not check the terminal window size and automatically adjust

The wrapper script `c3270.sh` checks the terminal size and uses the largest model possible for the window.
for changes.

**Note**: If the terminal window is at least 132 columns, `c3270.sh` will favor emulating a [3270 model 5](#Terminal-Sizes) over a taller but narrower terminal.

***Note***: If using `c3270.sh`, make the terminal window two lines *higher* than the desired the 3270 terminal size **before** running the program. This allows room for the top & bottom lines of chrome.
